                        <p>
                            The GP32 looks very similar to the original Gameboy Advance, which makes sense since it was made to compete with it.<br>
    It was a very different console compared to the it’s competitors since it was a open source console. This meant game developers could develop their own games for the console and then sell them completely royalty free.<br>
    It could also download music by connecting to a pc and play it through it’s MP3 format.<br>
    It could only run encrypted games, but developers could register their console for development and be given a free suite of tools to develop their games.<br>
    The open source nature of the console led to people developing way more than games, such as file management apps or even emulators for other consoles.<br>
    There were two more variants of the console released, focused on improving the illumination of the screen to help playing in poorly lit environments.

                    <p>
                        The GP32 was released on November 23rd, 2001 in South Korea and later in some parts of Europe, distributed by Virgin Play in Portugal, Spain and Italy and in the UK and Sweden by some official distributors.<br> 
    This console was funded by the government of South Korea, being the winner of a contest held by the government to enable a developer for a console that would break the monopoly of Japanese game console developers in South Korea.<br>
    During it’s commercial lifecycle it only had 28 commercial titles released, but it had a lot of homebrew titles and emulators.<br>
    Unfortunately it was a commercial failure, even if it was stronger than it’s competitors.

Some have even reached 256 MHz (not always stable, low battery life). Overclocking ability is random, however all GP32s are supposed to reach 133 MHz. A few early "bad" units maxed out at 132 MHz.)</li>

                                GP Link was a wireless dongle that could be inserted into the ext socket and let you chat and play games.<br>
