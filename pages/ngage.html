                            The N-Gage also known as the ‘Taco phone’ was the first hybrid of a smartphone and a handheld game system ever created.This device was created by Nokia to compete against Game Boy Advance, an objective too big for its own shoulder and it led to the cancellation of the product.
The N-GAGE due to being hibrid it had a very unique button layout having the numbers buttons and other buttons that were in every phone in the 2000 before touchscreen became the norm in his right also had a dpad that were used in most games for the system.
Even if this console failed in his pursuit of dethroning Nintendo from the king of the handhelds there is some merit to the N-GAGE due this having features that are mainstays of every console in the market nowadays like online multiplayer and leaderboards.
